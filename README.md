# Asteroids-SFML

I am still learning SFML and i thought I could try making asteroids.
It wasnt that difficult but there were still some problems.

I still need to make better collisions and some audio.

Also the game won't restart after destroying all asteroids or dying, it seemed to me like the last thing to add, so I will include it later.
